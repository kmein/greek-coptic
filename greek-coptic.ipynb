    "### Transliteration from Greek to Coptic\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we want to compare the (normative) Greek spelling to various actual Coptic spellings.\n",
    "The Greek and Coptic alphabets are handled by Unicode differently, so trying to find the differences between a word such as δίκαιος and ⲇⲓⲕⲁⲓⲟⲥ\n",
    "would highlight every letter as different, because the actual codepoints of the Greek and Coptic delta, iota etc. differ.\n",
    "We therefore need to \"transliterate\" (using quotes, because the alphabets are essentially the same) either the Coptic words into the Greek alphabet or the Greek words into the Coptic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the Coptic alphabet is a superset of the Greek and we would not be able to handle specifically Egyptian characters such as ϩ, ϣ etc., we choose to convert from Greek to Coptic. \n",
    "The following three steps are necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. NFD-normalization (see [Unicode® Standard Annex #15](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr15/) for more info): This step splits precomposed i.e. accented Greek letters into the underlying letter and one or more accent codepoints. For example: `ἅγιος` will be split into `α, ʿ, ΄, γ, ι, ο, ς`.\n",
    "2. Actual transliteration: The Greek characters (and their variants, such as ϑ or ς) are mapped to their Coptic equivalents, *spiritus asper* is mapped to `ϩ`, *iota subscriptum* to normal `ⲓ`, other accents are dropped.\n",
    "3. Reordering of ϩ-combinations: The last step applied to ἅγιος results in `ⲁϩⲅⲓⲟⲥ`, because according to the NFD specification, the combining breathing mark comes after the letter it applies to. Therefore any group of vowels (or *rho*) followed by ϩ must swap places with it. This also correctly converts `ⲁⲓϩⲣⲉⲱ` (← αἱρέω) to `ϩⲁⲓⲣⲉⲱ`. "

    "The task of finding the places where two spellings of the same word vary, e.g. finding out that the difference between `ⲇⲓⲕⲁⲓⲟⲥ` and `ⲇⲓⲕⲉⲟⲥ` lies in the substitution `ⲁⲓ → ⲉ`.\n",
    "Is analogous to the common computer science task of [file comparison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_comparison).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore simply use a tool built for file comparison—Python's built-in [difflib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/difflib.html) module—for our analysis.\n",
    "The algorithm used by this module is known as [*Gestalt* pattern matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_Pattern_Matching).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the more commonly used [Levenshtein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance), it works on arbitrarily long groups of characters, so the difference between the strings `ⲁⲣⲁⲯ` and `ⲁⲣⲁⲃⲟⲥ` is characterized as `replace ⲯ → ⲃⲟⲥ` instead of `replace ⲯ → ⲃ, insert ⲟ, insert ⲥ`. As can probably be seen, this better reflects the *gestalt* of the concrete difference in orthography.\n",
    "\n",
    "But how does it work? Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find the [longest common substring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_substring) of both spellings. If there are multiple ones of equal length, the one occuring earliest will take precedence. When comparing `ⲁⲣⲁⲯ` and `ⲁⲣⲁⲃⲟⲥ`, the longest common substring is `ⲁⲣⲁ`.\n",
    "2. Recurse into the left and right of that substring. Neither of the two strings has any characters left of the common substring `ⲁⲣⲁ`, so this recursion subtree is complete. To the right, we have the two strings `ⲯ` and `ⲃⲟⲥ`. We try to find the longest common substring of those two.\n",
    "3. If there is no common substring, we note the difference as `replace ⲯ → ⲃⲟⲥ`. If one or the other side is empty, this is notes as either `insert XYZ` (`replace ∅ → XYZ`) or `delete XYZ` (meaning  `replace XYZ → ∅`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example, this time comparing `ⲇⲓⲕⲁⲓⲟⲥ` to `ⲇⲓⲕⲉⲟⲥ`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Common subsequences are `ⲇⲓⲕ` and `ⲟⲥ`. We start with `ⲇⲓⲕ`, because it is longer.\n",
    "2. To the left of `ⲇⲓⲕ` both strings are empty (and thereby equal). To the right we have the strings `ⲁⲓⲟⲥ` and `ⲉⲟⲥ`.\n",
    "    1. Their longest common substring is `ⲟⲥ`.\n",
    "    2. To the left we have the strings `ⲁⲓ` and `ⲉ`. To the right both strings are empty (and thereby equal).\n",
    "3. There is no common substring between `ⲁⲓ` and `ⲉ`. We have therefore found the one differing point. We can characterize the difference as `replace ⲁⲓ → ⲉ`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is all done by the `SequenceMatcher` class. Its method `get_opcodes()` returns all changes and where in the string they apply."
